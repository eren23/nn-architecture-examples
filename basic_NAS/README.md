# Neural Architecture Search on MNIST

This script performs a basic form of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on the MNIST dataset. NAS is a method used to automatically determine the best neural network architecture for a given task. This script is designed to a the most basic form of NAS, and is intended to be used as a starting point and to be better understood by those new to the field.

(See the implementation details in the comments of the script.)
